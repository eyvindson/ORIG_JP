Peatland emission inventory - General description

1. General description of the calculation

The main design principle of this calculation is the minimization of user input. The only files
the user needs to concern themselves with are PATHS.R, defining the file input/output paths used by
the script files. CONSTANTS.R, as the name suggests, contains all the various constants
used by the scripts. Outside these two files, there should be no need to touch any of the other files;
just run main.R and all the rest of the calculation steps are automatic.
